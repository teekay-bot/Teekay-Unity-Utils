# Changelog

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Editor/Extensions/EditorExtensions.cs` — `PingAndSelect` extension for `Object`, adapted from [adammyhre/Unity-Utils](https://github.com/adammyhre/Unity-Utils) (MIT), with EditMode tests.
- `Editor/Utils/EditorFileUtils.cs` — `ConfirmOverwrite` / `BrowseForFolder` file-dialog helpers, adapted from the same source but converted from string extensions to plain static methods.

### Removed

- Smoke tests (`EditorSmokeTests`, `RuntimeSmokeTests`) — the pipeline is now proven by real tests. `TeekayUtils.Tests` (PlayMode) is currently empty, kept for future runtime code.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- `Tests/Editor` (`TeekayUtils.Tests.Editor`) and `Tests/Runtime` (`TeekayUtils.Tests`) assemblies with smoke tests proving the Test Runner pipeline.
- `DevProject~/` — embedded Unity 6000.3.10f1 host project (ignored by consumers) with the package referenced via `file:../..` and registered in `testables`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Initial empty package skeleton: `Runtime/` (`TeekayUtils`) and `Editor/` (`TeekayUtils.Editor`) assemblies, no code yet.
